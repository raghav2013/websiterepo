According to the Kubernetes website,

"Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications."

Kubernetes comes from the Greek word κυβερνήτης:, which means helmsman or ship pilot. With this analogy in mind, we can think of Kubernetes as the manager for shipping containers.

Kubernetes is also referred to as k8s, as there are 8 characters between k and s.

Kubernetes is highly inspired by the Google Borg system, which we will explore in this chapter. It is an open source project written in the Go language, and licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.

Kubernetes was started by Google and, with its v1.0 release in July 2015, Google donated it to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). We will talk more about CNCF later.

Generally, Kubernetes has new releases every three months. The current stable version is 1.9 (as of February 2018).
